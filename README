pun
===

The name "pun" is not an acronym meaning "-p und -n", and whoever might have
told you that was gravely misinformed. I can definitely see how such a rumour
gets started, though.

pun is Copyright (C) 2009, the pun contributors (as listed in AUTHORS).

usage
=====

In the following test runs, there's a command, then a line of input, a line of
output, and finally a manual EOF.

$ ./perl6n -e 'say eval($_)'
(~[*] 1..4).reverse
42
^D

$ ./perl6p -e '$_ = $_.subst(/(\d+) \+ (\d+)/, {$0+$1}, :g)'
"24+18!" he shouted amicably.
"42!" he shouted amicably.
^D

You might want to put the 'perl6n' and 'perl6p' scripts in the way of your
$PATH. That way, you can skip the initial './' above.
